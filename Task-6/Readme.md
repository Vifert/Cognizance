>The theme was to create a landing page that effectively communicated the product's image as the car of the future. Think I, Robot meets Tron Legacy.

>These movies about the future were my inspiration when designing the landing page. The neon lights and sleek dark background helps to tell a story and captivates the viewer by enhancing their imagination of the perfect future car.

### Features:

To compete with all other makes and models, the 2021 Audi e-tron comes with its array of comfort features, technological changes, and safety features to ensure it is a smooth and safe ride for all. Being an SUV, the new Audi can hold up to four people on the interior and provide them the comfort of a spacious cabin with unique contrast-color stitching inside. When it comes to technology, the Audi comes with an upgraded MMI system, including a navigation system, media controls, and Bluetooth phone connections with displays on the screen. Other comfort features include climate control with interior air filtration, electric power steering, and bucket front and rear seats. Safety-wise, the Audi comes with some of the standard features such as rear door locks and child seat anchors for any younger passengers inside. A forward-collision warning system is in place to help drivers stay alert for cars ahead of them. In addition to this, there is also a rear-cross traffic display that alerts the driver about any traffic incoming while they are attempting to switch lanes. Stability and traction control have all been improved, and a new 4-wheel ABS system is in place to keep watch of this.
